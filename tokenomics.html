      <h1>Tokenomics Philosophy</h1>
      <h2>Designed to serve people, not extract from them</h2>

      <p>
        B2H economics are not built to enrich a few.
        They are built to endure, protect value,
        and continuously serve humanity.

    <h3>Why We Chose Restraint</h3>

    <p>
      Many projects chase attention through complexity,
      speed, or unrealistic promises.
    </p>

    <p>
      B2H deliberately chooses restraint.
      Because systems that last
      are built with discipline,
      not excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our economic design avoids mechanisms
      that create artificial pressure,
      hidden extraction,
      or short-term speculation.
    </p>

    <h3>Burn With Meaning</h3>

    <p>
      In B2H, reduction is not destruction.
      It is transformation.
    </p>

    <p>
      When value is reduced through burn,
      a portion is redirected
      toward humanitarian impact
      and long-term sustainability.
    </p>

    <p>
      This ensures that growth
      never becomes detached
      from human responsibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Protection Over Aggression</h3>

    <p>
      B2H avoids systems
      that punish participants
      or reward insiders unfairly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation is structured
      to be understandable,
      ethical,
      and resistant to manipulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Value protection exists
      so families can participate
      without fear of hidden harm.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Long-Term Sustainability</h3>

    <p>
      Humanitarian work cannot survive
      without stability.
    </p>

    <p>
      B2H economics are designed
      so that operational needs,
      outreach,
      and aid can continue
      even in difficult conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sustainability exists
      to protect the mission —
      not to weaken it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>What We Do Not Disclose</h3>

    <p>
      To protect this mission
      from exploitation or hostile copying,
      detailed mechanics,
      ratios,
      and thresholds
      are not publicly exposed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants are invited
      to evaluate B2H
      based on principles,
      transparency,
      and lived accountability —
      not hype.
