  <h3>The B2H Constitution</h3>

  <p>
    B2H exists to serve humanity.
    This purpose is permanent and cannot be replaced,
    diluted, or ignored.
  </p>

  <p>
    The poor, the vulnerable, and the forgotten
    are not beneficiaries —
    they are the reason this project exists.
  </p>

  <p>
    No person owns B2H.
    Leadership is a duty of service,
    not a right to profit or control.
  </p>

  <p>
    All systems, funds, and authority
    must remain aligned with the mission
    to reduce human suffering
    and protect dignity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Decisions must be guided by conscience,
    not greed;
    by compassion,
    not convenience;
    by responsibility,
    not power.
  </p>

  <p>
    If leadership ever fails this mission,
    the mission must outlive leadership.
    The purpose of B2H must never be sacrificed
    for personal gain or external pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transparency is not optional.
    Accountability is not conditional.
    Trust must be earned continuously.
  </p>

  <p>
    This constitution stands as a promise —
    to humanity today
    and to generations tomorrow —
    that B2H will always choose
    service over self.
