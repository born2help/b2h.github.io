  <h3>Transparency Framework</h3>

  <p>
    Transparency in B2H exists to protect trust —
    not to expose the vulnerable,
    invite exploitation,
    or enable hostile actors.
  </p>

  <p>
    This framework defines what is shared,
    what is protected,
    and why restraint is an ethical necessity.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Why Transparency Has Limits</h3>

  <p>
    Absolute transparency is not always ethical.
    When dealing with humanitarian aid,
    financial flows, and vulnerable communities,
    exposure can create harm.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H rejects transparency theater.
    Trust is built through responsibility,
    not through reckless disclosure.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>What B2H Commits to Disclose</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Mission purpose and ethical constraints</li>
    <li>Governance structure and safeguards</li>
    <li>Participation principles and risk warnings</li>
    <li>High-level humanitarian impact summaries</li>
    <li>Operational intent and use-of-funds categories</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This information ensures understanding
    without enabling misuse.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>What B2H Will Not Publicly Disclose</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Exact wallet addresses or internal accounts</li>
    <li>Detailed logistics of aid distribution</li>
    <li>Personal identities of recipients</li>
    <li>Security-sensitive operational data</li>
    <li>Private continuity designations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Withholding this information
    protects people, not power.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Transparency Without Financial Hype</h3>

  <p>
    B2H does not publish price targets,
    projections, profit forecasts,
    or speculative metrics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Financial discussion is limited
    to responsibility, sustainability,
    and ethical boundaries —
    never promises.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Use of Funds — Ethical Disclosure</h3>

  <p>
    Funds are used strictly for:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Humanitarian assistance</li>
    <li>Operational sustainability</li>
    <li>Security, compliance, and protection</li>
    <li>Minimal logistics and coordination</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Excess, luxury, or extraction
    is explicitly prohibited.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Privacy Is a Form of Protection</h3>

  <p>
    Public exposure of beneficiaries
    can lead to stigma, targeting,
    and further harm.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H protects dignity
    by refusing to turn suffering
    into content or marketing.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Independent Accountability (When Safe)</h3>

  <p>
    Where feasible and safe,
    B2H may engage trusted,
    ethically aligned reviewers
    to verify practices privately.
  </p>

  <p>
    No reviewer may demand
    control, influence,
    or governance authority.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Handling Misinformation & False Claims</h3>

  <p>
    Any individual claiming guaranteed returns,
    inside access,
    or special authority
    does not represent B2H.
  </p>

  <p>
    Silence in response to hype
    is intentional —
    restraint protects people.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Transparency During Crisis</h3>

  <p>
    During legal, political,
    or security pressure,
    disclosures may be reduced
    to protect beneficiaries
    and humanitarian continuity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ethics override optics.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Amanah (Trust)</h3>

  <p>
    In Islamic accountability,
    amanah is sacred.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trust is broken not only
    by lying,
    but also by careless truth
    that causes harm.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Final Transparency Principle</h3>

  <p>
    B2H will always choose
    responsible silence
    over harmful exposure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transparency serves people —
    people do not serve transparency.
