      <h1>Transparency</h1>
      <h2>Trust is sacred. It is never optional.</h2>

      <p>
        B2H exists only because people choose to trust.
        That trust must be protected with discipline,
        honesty, and restraint.

    <h3>Our Responsibility</h3>

    <p>
      Every resource connected to B2H carries responsibility.
      Nothing exists for luxury, excess, or personal enrichment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Funds are treated as a trust —
      not as ownership,
      not as entitlement,
      but as a responsibility before humanity and before Allah.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Use of Resources</h3>

    <p>
      Resources within B2H are used only for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Humanitarian assistance and relief</li>
      <li>Operational sustainability required to serve people</li>
      <li>Outreach and education for the mission</li>
      <li>Basic governance and accountability functions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      No resource exists for personal luxury,
      unchecked salaries,
      or speculative behavior.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Founder & Leadership Discipline</h3>

    <p>
      Leadership within B2H is a responsibility —
      not a privilege.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any operational support required for leadership
      exists only to allow the mission to continue responsibly,
      not to extract wealth from the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Decisions are made with restraint,
      accountability,
      and the understanding that misuse breaks trust forever.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>What We Do Not Publish</h3>

    <p>
      To protect this mission from misuse,
      exploitation,
      or hostile copying,
      B2H does not publicly disclose
      sensitive operational details.
    </p>

    <p>
      Transparency is maintained through principles,
      audits where appropriate,
      and public accountability —
      not through exposure that endangers the mission.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Our Promise</h3>

    <p>
      As B2H grows,
      transparency will grow with it —
      carefully,
      responsibly,
      and without compromising security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trust is not something we ask for.
      It is something we earn,
      every day,
      through actions.
