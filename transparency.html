  <h3>Transparency & Accountability</h3>

  <p>
    Trust is not built with words alone.
    It is built with structure, restraint,
    and the courage to be accountable.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H exists to serve humanity.
    Transparency is therefore not optional —
    it is a responsibility.
  </p>

  <h3>How Resources Are Used</h3>

  <p>
    All resources connected to B2H exist for
    clearly defined purposes.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Humanitarian aid and relief efforts</li>
    <li>Operational sustainability</li>
    <li>Outreach, awareness, and partnerships</li>
    <li>Long-term protection of the mission</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    No resources exist for personal luxury,
    excessive compensation,
    or hidden enrichment.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Burns & Humanitarian Impact</h3>

  <p>
    A portion of every burn is directed
    toward helping people in need.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another portion strengthens the project’s
    ability to operate independently,
    without reliance on interest-based systems
    or exploitative funding.
  </p>

  <p>
    This balance ensures that B2H can help today
    and continue helping tomorrow.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Operational Integrity</h3>

  <p>
    Leadership within B2H exists as responsibility,
    not ownership.
  </p>

  <p>
    All operational expenses are limited to what is
    necessary to maintain, protect, and expand
    humanitarian impact.
  </p>

  <p>
    Decisions are evaluated against one question:
    does this reduce suffering and protect dignity?
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Public Accountability</h3>

  <p>
    As B2H grows, periodic summaries and disclosures
    will be shared publicly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transparency will evolve responsibly —
    increasing clarity without compromising
    security or the safety of those involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Silence, secrecy, and manipulation
    have no place in this project.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <p>
    B2H does not ask for blind trust.
    It asks for informed participation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page stands as a commitment —
    that honesty, restraint, and accountability
    will guide every step forward.
