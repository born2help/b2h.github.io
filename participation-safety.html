      <h1>🛡 Participation Safety</h1>
      <h2>Trust must be protected, not requested</h2>

      <p>
        B2H exists to help — not to exploit.
        People do not participate blindly;
        they participate when they feel safe,
        respected, and protected.

  <!-- HEART & RESPONSIBILITY -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Read This First</h3>

    <p>
      Life teaches us something slowly:
      good intentions are not enough.
      Responsibility matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project exists to help humanity —
      not to create financial stress,
      false hope,
      or pressure on anyone.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- NO PROMISES -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>No Guaranteed Returns</h3>

    <p>
      B2H does not promise profits,
      price appreciation,
      or financial certainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participation must be made
      with full understanding of risk,
      patience,
      and responsibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHO SHOULD / SHOULD NOT -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Who Should Participate</h3>

    <p>
      Participation is meant only for those
      who can do so calmly,
      without harming their family,
      without sacrificing necessities,
      and without borrowing or pressure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Who Should Not Participate</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Anyone facing hardship or debt</li>
      <li>Anyone under emotional pressure or fear</li>
      <li>Anyone replacing basic family needs</li>
      <li>Anyone acting out of desperation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If participation creates burden,
      it should not be done.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- NO HYPE -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>No Pressure, No Hype</h3>

    <p>
      There are no deadlines,
      no urgency tactics,
      and no emotional manipulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If protecting people requires slowing down,
      we choose to slow down.
    </p>

  <!-- FOUNDER & STRUCTURE -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Founder Responsibility</h3>

    <p>
      The founder of B2H does not own this mission.
      He carries it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Leadership exists only to protect purpose,
      ensure continuity,
      and uphold accountability —
      never to extract wealth or power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Authority is limited
      by the Constitution
      and the Mission Lock.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SAFEGUARDS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Safeguards Against Abuse</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>No sudden rule changes harming participants</li>
      <li>No hidden extraction of value</li>
      <li>No concentration of unchecked authority</li>
      <li>No mission drift due to profit pressure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Every decision must align
      with humanitarian purpose.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONTINUITY -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>If Leadership Changes</h3>

    <p>
      No individual is permanent —
      the mission is.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if leadership changes,
      the Mission Lock,
      ethical constraints,
      and humanitarian priority
      remain intact.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ISLAMIC FOUNDATION -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Amanah (Trust)</h3>

    <p>
      In Islamic accountability,
      amanah is sacred.
    </p>

    <p>
      Breaking trust
      is worse than failure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every decision in B2H
      is weighed against conscience
      before it is weighed against success.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FINAL COMMITMENT -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Our Commitment</h3>

    <p>
      Growth that harms people
      is not success.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if B2H becomes large,
      it must still protect
      the smallest participant.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
  <h3>Founder & Leadership Responsibility</h3>
  <p>The founder of B2H does not own this mission. He carries it.</p>
  <p>Leadership exists only to protect purpose, ensure continuity, and uphold accountability — never to extract wealth or power.</p>
  <p>Any authority held by leadership is limited by the Constitution and the Mission Lock.</p>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Continuity & Mission Lock</h3>
  <p>No individual is permanent — the mission is.</p>
  <p>If leadership changes, the Mission Lock, ethical constraints, and humanitarian priority remain intact.</p>
  <p>This ensures continuity without dependence on a single person.</p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Transparency Without Exposure</h3>
  <p>Safety does not require recklessness.</p>
  <p>B2H balances transparency with protection against exploitation, theft, and hostile copying.</p>
  <p>Information is shared responsibly — not for attention, but for trust.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Amanah (Trust)</h3>
  <p>In Islamic accountability, amanah is sacred. Breaking trust is worse than failure.</p>
  <p>Every decision within B2H is weighed against conscience before it is weighed against success.</p>
