      <h1>🛡 Participation Safety</h1>
      <h2>Protection before profit. Ethics before growth.</h2>
      <p>
        B2H exists to help — not to exploit. Participation is voluntary, informed,
        and grounded in responsibility.

  <!-- Core Safety Sections -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>No Guaranteed Returns</h3>
    <p>
      B2H does not promise profits, returns, price appreciation, or financial outcomes.
      Any participation must be made with full understanding of risk and responsibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>No Pressure, No Hype</h3>
    <p>
      There are no deadlines, no fear tactics, and no urgency messaging.
      Participation should never be rushed or emotionally manipulated.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Protection Against Misuse</h3>
    <p>
      Activities such as manipulation, false claims, insider advantage,
      or exploitative behavior are rejected and discouraged.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Voluntary & Informed Participation</h3>
    <p>
      Every participant is responsible for their own decisions.
      B2H encourages understanding, patience, and ethical alignment
      before any involvement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
    <p>
      The mission will never be sacrificed for growth, popularity, or money.
      If protecting people requires slowing down, we choose to slow down.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Practical Safety Sections -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Read This First</h3>
    <p>
      Life teaches us something slowly: good intentions are not enough.
      Responsibility matters. This project exists to help humanity —
      not to create financial stress, false hope, or pressure on anyone.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Who Should Participate</h3>
    <p>
      Participation is meant only for those who can do so calmly,
      without harming their family, without sacrificing necessities,
      and without borrowing or pressure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Who Should Not Participate</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cause hardship or debt</li>
      <li>Create emotional pressure or fear</li>
      <li>Replace basic family needs</li>
      <li>Be done out of desperation</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>No Promises of Certainty</h3>
    <p>
      B2H does not promise guaranteed returns, instant wealth, or risk-free outcomes.
      Anyone claiming otherwise does not speak for this project.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Conscience Over Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Growth that harms people is not success. Even if B2H grows large,
      it must still protect the smallest participant.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>A Personal Note</h3>
    <p>
      This project was shaped by years of observing how easily hope can be misused.
      B2H chooses restraint where others choose hype, because some lessons
      are learned only with time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Founder Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
      The founder of B2H does not own this mission. He carries it.
      Leadership exists only to protect purpose, ensure continuity,
      and uphold accountability — never to extract wealth or power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any authority held by leadership is limited by the Constitution
      and the Mission Lock.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Safeguards Against Abuse</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sudden rule changes that harm participants</li>
      <li>Hidden extraction of value</li>
      <li>Concentration of unchecked authority</li>
      <li>Mission drift caused by profit pressure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Decisions affecting participation must always align with humanitarian purpose.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>What Happens If Leadership Changes</h3>
    <p>
      No individual is permanent — the mission is.
      If leadership changes, the Mission Lock, ethical constraints,
      and humanitarian priority remain intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ensures continuity without dependence on a single person.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Transparency Without Exposure</h3>
    <p>
      Safety does not require recklessness. B2H balances transparency
      with protection against exploitation, theft, and hostile copying.
      Information is shared responsibly — not for attention, but for trust.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Amanah (Trust)</h3>
    <p>
      In Islamic accountability, amanah is sacred.
      Breaking trust is worse than failure.
      Every decision within B2H is weighed against conscience before it is weighed against success.
    </p>
  </section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Founder Continuity & Protection</h3>

  <p>
    B2H was initiated as an amanah (trust), not as a position of power.
    For this reason, the founder cannot be removed, overridden,
    or sidelined by any individual, group, or interest
    as long as he remains mentally capable and ethically aligned
    with the Constitution of B2H.
  </p>

  <p>
    This protection exists to prevent hostile takeovers,
    greed-driven interference,
    or mission distortion under the name of reform or efficiency.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Succession Through Trust — Not Ambition</h3>

  <p>
    If the founder becomes physically weak, aged,
    or unable to carry out daily responsibilities,
    authority does not pass to outsiders, investors,
    or those seeking influence.
  </p>

 <p>
    B2H is protected against leadership removal,
    hostile takeovers, coercion,
    and mission drift.
  </p>

  <p>
    The founder cannot be removed,
    overridden, or replaced
    while he is mentally capable,
    ethically aligned,
    and actively safeguarding the mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the event of age, illness,
    or reduced capacity,
    authority transfers only
    to individuals personally designated
    by the founder during his lifetime.
  </p>

  <p>
    No public vote, investor group,
    committee, or external body
    has the authority
    to remove or override this protection.
  </p>
</section>
  
  <p>
    Continuity is entrusted only to individuals
    personally designated by the founder,
    based on proven character, restraint,
    and long-term alignment with humanitarian purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    No position within B2H may be claimed,
    purchased, negotiated, or inherited through pressure.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Protection Against Greed & Hostile Entry</h3>

  <p>
    B2H assumes that not all who approach the project
    do so with pure intentions.
    Some may seek recognition, control, or extraction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Structural safeguards exist to ensure that
    no individual or group can enter B2H
    and redirect its mission toward personal gain,
    even under the appearance of growth or professionalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    Authority is conditional.
    Purpose is permanent.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Final Ethical Anchor</h3>

  <p>
    In Islamic accountability, removing a trustworthy guardian
    without ethical cause is a violation of amanah.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, leadership continuity in B2H
    is governed by conscience, constitution,
    and responsibility before Allah —
    not by popularity, power, or capital.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Emergency Continuity & Abuse Resistance</h3>

  <p>
    B2H is designed under the assumption that real-world abuse,
    pressure, and manipulation will eventually occur.
    This framework exists to ensure that no crisis,
    internal or external, can divert its humanitarian mission.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Scenario: Sudden Death or Permanent Incapacity</h3>

  <p>
    In the event of sudden death or irreversible incapacity
    of the founder, authority transfers only
    to pre-designated custodians recorded privately
    by the founder during his lifetime.
  </p>

  <p>
    No public vote, emergency board,
    investor group, or external body
    may claim leadership during this period.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Scenario: Legal, Financial, or State Pressure</h3>

  <p>
    If B2H faces legal threats, regulatory pressure,
    or forced restructuring attempts,
    humanitarian operations must continue independently
    from governance disputes.
  </p>

  <p>
    No compliance action may override
    the ethical mission or redirect funds
    away from the poor and vulnerable.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Scenario: Internal Betrayal or Mission Drift</h3>

  <p>
    Any individual or group attempting to redirect B2H
    toward personal gain, political influence,
    or ideological control
    is automatically disqualified from authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    Growth that compromises conscience
    is treated as failure.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Immutable Mission Clause</h3>

  <p>
    B2H exists solely to protect humanity,
    support the poor, and act with restraint.
  </p>

  <p>
    This mission is immutable.
    It cannot be amended, diluted,
    or reinterpreted for profit,
    popularity, or power —
    regardless of circumstances.
