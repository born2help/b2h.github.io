<!-- HERO -->
<section class="hero">
  <div class="hero-left">
    <h1>🛡 Participation Safety</h1>
    <h2>Protection before profit. Ethics before growth.</h2>
    <p>
      B2H exists to help — not to exploit.
      Participation is voluntary, informed, and grounded in responsibility.

<!-- CORE PRINCIPLES -->
<section class="section light">
  <h3>No Guaranteed Returns</h3>
  <p>
    B2H does not promise profits, returns, price appreciation,
    or financial outcomes of any kind.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>No Pressure, No Hype</h3>
  <p>
    There are no deadlines, fear tactics, urgency messaging,
    or emotional manipulation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Voluntary & Informed Participation</h3>
  <p>
    Participation should never harm family stability,
    basic needs, or emotional well-being.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Who Should Not Participate</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If participation causes debt or hardship</li>
    <li>If it replaces family necessities</li>
    <li>If done out of desperation or fear</li>
    <li>If motivated by guaranteed expectations</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- CONSCIENCE -->
<section class="section light">
  <h3>Conscience Over Numbers</h3>
  <p>
    Growth that harms people is not success.
    Even at scale, B2H must protect the smallest participant.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Amanah (Trust)</h3>
  <p>
    In Islamic accountability, amanah is sacred.
    Breaking trust is worse than failure.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- FOUNDER RESPONSIBILITY -->
<section class="section light">
  <h3>Founder Responsibility</h3>
  <p>
    The founder of B2H does not own this mission.
    He carries it as an amanah.
  </p>
  <p>
    Authority exists only to protect purpose,
    ensure continuity, and uphold accountability.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- FOUNDER PROTECTION & CONTINUITY -->
<section class="section">
  <h3>Founder Continuity & Protection</h3>
  <p>
    The founder cannot be removed, overridden,
    or sidelined by any individual or group
    as long as he remains mentally capable
    and ethically aligned with the Constitution.
  </p>
  <p>
    This protection exists to prevent greed,
    hostile takeovers, and mission distortion.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Succession Through Trust — Not Ambition</h3>
  <p>
    In case of age, illness, or reduced capacity,
    authority transfers only to individuals
    personally designated by the founder.
  </p>
  <p>
    No investor group, vote, committee,
    or external body may override this safeguard.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ANTI-ABUSE -->
<section class="section">
  <h3>Protection Against Abuse & Greed</h3>
  <p>
    B2H assumes that not all who approach it
    do so with pure intentions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Structural safeguards ensure that no one
    can redirect the mission toward personal gain.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Emergency Continuity Scenarios</h3>
  <p>
    In cases of death, incapacity, legal pressure,
    or internal betrayal, humanitarian purpose
    remains protected and uninterrupted.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Immutable Mission Clause</h3>
  <p>
    B2H exists solely to protect humanity
    and support the poor with restraint and dignity.
  </p>
  <p>
    This mission is immutable and cannot be altered
    for profit, popularity, or power.
