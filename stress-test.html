  <h3>Stress-Test Scenarios</h3>

  <p>
    B2H is designed with the assumption that
    real-world pressure, misuse attempts,
    and unethical behavior will occur.
  </p>

  <p>
    These stress-test scenarios exist
    to demonstrate how the mission,
    governance, and founder safeguards
    remain intact under extreme conditions.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Scenario 1: Founder Incapacity or Death</h3>

  <p>
    If the founder becomes unable to serve
    due to illness, incapacity, or death,
    the mission of B2H does not pause,
    collapse, or become leaderless.
  </p>

  <p>
    Authority transitions only to
    pre-designated custodians chosen
    by the founder while fully capable.
  </p>

  <p>
    No external party, investor,
    or committee may claim control.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Scenario 2: Governance Capture Attempt</h3>

  <p>
    Any attempt to seize control through
    committees, votes, popularity,
    or internal coordination
    is automatically invalid.
  </p>

  <p>
    Governance exists to serve the mission,
    not to redefine it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ethical clauses override all
    procedural or numerical authority.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Scenario 3: Capital or Investment Pressure</h3>

  <p>
    Financial contribution does not grant
    ownership, voting rights,
    or influence over direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H explicitly rejects
    capital-based governance models.
  </p>

  <p>
    Money may support the mission,
    but it can never command it.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Scenario 4: Legal or Regulatory Pressure</h3>

  <p>
    If legal, political, or regulatory pressure
    attempts to force mission dilution,
    redirection, or exploitation,
    such demands are rejected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Compliance may occur only when
    it does not violate conscience,
    ethics, or humanitarian purpose.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Scenario 5: Internal Betrayal or Drift</h3>

  <p>
    If any internal body,
    representative, or advisor
    attempts to shift priorities
    toward personal benefit,
    authority is immediately void.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leadership is conditional.
    Purpose is permanent.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Scenario 6: Popularity or Social Pressure</h3>

  <p>
    B2H does not follow trends,
    hype, or public pressure
    when such forces conflict
    with ethical responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Growth that harms dignity,
    conscience, or safety
    is considered failure.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Scenario 7: Technical or Operational Failure</h3>

  <p>
    In case of technical failure,
    operational error,
    or unexpected disruption,
    humanitarian purpose
    remains the guiding priority.
  </p>

  <p>
    Redundancy, documentation,
    and ethical oversight ensure
    continuity and trust preservation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Stress-Test Conclusion</h3>

  <p>
    These scenarios demonstrate that
    B2H is resistant to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hostile takeovers</li>
    <li>Capital-based control</li>
    <li>Internal manipulation</li>
    <li>Ethical erosion</li>
    <li>Mission drift</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Authority may change.
    Structures may evolve.
    The mission does not.
