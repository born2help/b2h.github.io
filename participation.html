      <h2>Protection before profit. Ethics before growth.</h2>

      <p>
        B2H exists to help — not to exploit.
        Participation is voluntary, informed,
        and grounded in responsibility.

    <h3>No Guaranteed Returns</h3>
    <p>
      B2H does not promise profits, returns,
      price appreciation, or financial outcomes.
      Any participation must be made with full understanding
      of risk and responsibility.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>No Pressure, No Hype</h3>
    <p>
      There are no deadlines, no fear tactics,
      and no urgency messaging.
      Participation should never be rushed
      or emotionally manipulated.

    <h3>Protection Against Misuse</h3>
    <p>
      Activities such as manipulation,
      false claims, insider advantage,
      or exploitative behavior
      are rejected and discouraged.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Voluntary & Informed Participation</h3>
    <p>
      Every participant is responsible
      for their own decisions.
      B2H encourages understanding,
      patience, and ethical alignment
      before any involvement.
    </p>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
    <p>
      The mission will never be sacrificed
      for growth, popularity, or money.
      If protecting people requires slowing down,
      we choose to slow down.
