      <h2>Protection before profit. Ethics before growth.</h2>

      <p>
        B2H exists to help — not to exploit. Participation is voluntary, informed,
        and grounded in responsibility.

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>No Guaranteed Returns</h3>
    <p>
      B2H does not promise profits, returns, price appreciation, or financial outcomes.
      Any participation must be made with full understanding of risk and responsibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>No Pressure, No Hype</h3>
    <p>
      There are no deadlines, no fear tactics, and no urgency messaging.
      Participation should never be rushed or emotionally manipulated.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Protection Against Misuse</h3>
    <p>
      Activities such as manipulation, false claims, insider advantage,
      or exploitative behavior are rejected and discouraged.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Voluntary & Informed Participation</h3>
    <p>
      Every participant is responsible for their own decisions.
      B2H encourages understanding, patience, and ethical alignment
      before any involvement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
    <p>
      The mission will never be sacrificed for growth, popularity, or money.
      If protecting people requires slowing down, we choose to slow down.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Read This First</h3>
    <p>
      Life teaches us something slowly: good intentions are not enough.
      Responsibility matters. This project exists to help humanity —
      not to create financial stress, false hope, or pressure on anyone.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Who Should Participate</h3>
    <p>
      Participation is meant only for those who can do so calmly,
      without harming their family, without sacrificing necessities,
      and without borrowing or pressure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Who Should Not Participate</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cause hardship or debt</li>
      <li>Create emotional pressure or fear</li>
      <li>Replace basic family needs</li>
      <li>Be done out of desperation</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>No Promises of Certainty</h3>
    <p>
      B2H does not promise guaranteed returns, instant wealth, or risk-free outcomes.
      Anyone claiming otherwise does not speak for this project.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Conscience Over Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Growth that harms people is not success. Even if B2H grows large,
      it must still protect the smallest participant.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>A Personal Note</h3>
    <p>
      This project was shaped by years of observing how easily hope can be misused.
      B2H chooses restraint where others choose hype, because some lessons
      are learned only with time.
