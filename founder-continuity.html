  <h3>Founder Continuity & Succession Lock</h3>

  <p>
    B2H was established as an amanah (trust),
    not as a transferable position of power.
    Leadership exists only to safeguard
    the mission — never to dominate it.
  </p>

  <p>
    This framework ensures continuity,
    protection against capture,
    and immunity from greed-driven removal.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Founder Protection Clause</h3>

  <p>
    The founder of B2H cannot be removed,
    overridden, suspended, or sidelined
    by any individual, committee,
    vote, investor group, or external authority
    as long as he remains:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Mentally capable</li>
    <li>Ethically aligned with the Constitution</li>
    <li>Actively safeguarding the mission</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This protection exists to prevent
    hostile takeovers, internal coups,
    popularity-based displacement,
    or capital-driven interference.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>No Ownership — Only Guardianship</h3>

  <p>
    The founder does not own B2H.
    He is its first guardian.
  </p>

  <p>
    Authority is not a right,
    a reward, or an entitlement.
    It is a responsibility
    that exists only to protect people.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Limits on Founder Authority</h3>

  <p>
    Founder protection does not mean
    unlimited power.
  </p>

  <p>
    The founder may not:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Redirect the mission for personal gain</li>
    <li>Extract wealth or luxury</li>
    <li>Suppress ethical accountability</li>
    <li>Override the Constitution</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Protection exists to guard purpose,
    not to enable abuse.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Succession Through Trust — Not Ambition</h3>

  <p>
    In the event of age, illness,
    or reduced physical capacity,
    authority does not transfer automatically,
    publicly, or competitively.
  </p>

  <p>
    Succession occurs only through
    private, lifetime designation
    by the founder.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Designated Custodians</h3>

  <p>
    Custodians are selected based on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Proven character</li>
    <li>Long-term restraint</li>
    <li>Resistance to greed</li>
    <li>Alignment with humanitarian purpose</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    No custodian gains ownership,
    permanent authority,
    or personal entitlement.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Absolute Rejection of External Control</h3>

  <p>
    No external body — including
    governments, investors,
    donors, committees, or boards —
    may remove the founder
    or override succession designations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Compliance may occur only when
    it does not violate conscience,
    mission, or humanitarian priority.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Emergency Continuity Clause</h3>

  <p>
    In the event of sudden death
    or irreversible incapacity,
    authority immediately transfers
    to pre-designated custodians.
  </p>

  <p>
    No interim voting,
    emergency board,
    or temporary control body
    is permitted.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Protection Against Greed & Manipulation</h3>

  <p>
    B2H assumes that some individuals
    will attempt to enter with
    ambition, control motives,
    or extraction intent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Structural safeguards ensure
    that no one can climb,
    negotiate, purchase,
    or pressure their way
    into authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    Authority is conditional.
    Purpose is permanent.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Final Ethical Anchor</h3>

  <p>
    In Islamic accountability,
    removing a trustworthy guardian
    without ethical cause
    is a violation of amanah.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, leadership continuity
    in B2H is governed by conscience,
    constitution, and responsibility
    before Allah —
    not by power, popularity, or capital.
