    <p>
      A global mission where every participation contributes to helping
      the poor, protecting human dignity, and building a future that
      Allah loves.

    <p>
      B2H is built for people who believe that doing good and protecting
      value can exist together — for our families, for our children,
      and for those who have nothing.
