  <h3>About the Founder</h3>
  <p>
    I was not born with wealth, influence, or security.
    I was born into the same world many of you know —
    a world where survival comes before dreams.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have lived long enough to understand something painful:
    most suffering is invisible.
    People do not cry loudly.
    They endure quietly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have watched parents smile in front of their children
    while their hearts were breaking inside.
    I have seen capable people lose hope,
    not because they were weak,
    but because help never arrived.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am 56 years old.
    Time has taught me that life does not ask who deserves pain.
    It simply gives it.
    And one day, I realized:
    if I remain silent, I become part of the injustice.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project was not created to make me important.
    It was created because I could no longer ignore the quiet suffering
    happening all around us.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H exists because someone must choose to care —
    not once, not for attention,
    but every day, for as long as they are alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not promise perfection.
    I promise sincerity.
    I promise that every decision will be weighed
    against one simple question:
    does this help a human being?
  </p>

  <p>
    If one day I am gone,
    let this project continue with the same purpose:
    to protect dignity,
    to reduce suffering,
    and to remind the world
    that humanity still matters.
