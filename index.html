<!-- ================= STEP 3 — FOUNDER AUTHORITY ================= -->

    <div class="founder-badge">Founder Declaration</div>

    <h3>Authority & Continuity</h3>

    <p>
      B2H was not established for recognition, wealth, or influence.
      It was established as a responsibility before Allah
      and a response to silent human suffering.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Founder holds authority only to protect purpose,
      dignity, and trust — never to extract personal,
      political, or financial benefit.
    </p>

    <div class="founder-lock">
      This mission is permanent. It cannot be diluted,
      redirected, sold, or compromised — now or in the future.
    </div>

    <div class="founder-signature">
      — Founder, B2H (Burn to Help)

<!-- ================= MISSION & PROMISE ================= -->

  <div class="mission-card">
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      B2H was not created as a trend, a business, or a promise of quick wealth.
      It was created from responsibility — toward people who suffer quietly,
      and toward Allah, who sees every intention.
    </p>

    <p>
      B2H exists to become that someone —
      to transform participation into relief,
      value into dignity,
      and growth into real human impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mission is lifelong.
      It exists to reduce suffering, protect dignity,
      and ensure that helping others remains central.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="promise-card">
    <h3>Our Promise</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No interest (Riba)</li>
      <li>No exploitation</li>
      <li>No personal enrichment</li>
      <li>Every contribution serves humanity only</li>
