    <p>“We were not created to accumulate endlessly, but to protect dignity,
    relieve suffering, and leave behind goodness that Allah accepts.”</p>

    <p>“This mission was not created for wealth, power, or recognition. It was
    created because silence in the face of suffering is also a form of injustice.”</p>

<!-- ================= MISSION & PROMISE ================= -->
<section class="mission-wrapper">

  <div class="mission-card">
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      B2H was not created as a trend, a business, or a promise of quick wealth.
      It was created from responsibility — toward people who suffer quietly,
      and toward Allah, who sees every intention.
    </p>

     <p>
    B2H exists to become that someone —
    to transform participation into relief,
    value into dignity,
    and growth into real human impact.
  </p>

    <p>
    This mission is not temporary.
    It is a lifelong commitment to reduce suffering,
    protect human dignity,
    and ensure that helping others remains at the heart of everything we do.
  </p>
    
    <p>
      Around the world, millions endure with dignity while hoping that someone,
      somewhere, still cares. B2H exists to become that someone.
