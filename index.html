  <h1>Burn to Help</h1>
  <h2>Born for Humanity</h2>

  <p>
    A global mission where every participation
    contributes to helping the poor,
    protecting human dignity,
    and building a future
    that Allah loves.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H is built for people who believe
    that doing good and protecting value
    can exist together —
    for our families,
    for our children,
    and for those who have nothing.

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      B2H is a humanitarian initiative built on sacrifice, sincerity,
      and lifelong service to people in need.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Our Promise</h3>
    <p>
      No interest. No exploitation. No personal gain.
      Every contribution exists for humanity only.
    </p>
  </section>
  
<section class="section">
  <h3>About the Founder</h3>
  <p>
    I was not born with wealth, influence, or security.
    I was born into the same world many of you know —
    a world where survival comes before dreams.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have lived long enough to understand something painful:
    most suffering is invisible.
    People do not cry loudly.
    They endure quietly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have watched parents smile in front of their children
    while their hearts were breaking inside.
    I have seen capable people lose hope,
    not because they were weak,
    but because help never arrived.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am 56 years old.
    Time has taught me that life does not ask who deserves pain.
    It simply gives it.
    And one day, I realized:
    if I remain silent, I become part of the injustice.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project was not created to make me important.
    It was created because I could no longer ignore the quiet suffering
    happening all around us.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H exists because someone must choose to care —
    not once, not for attention,
    but every day, for as long as they are alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not promise perfection.
    I promise sincerity.
    I promise that every decision will be weighed
    against one simple question:
    does this help a human being?
  </p>

  <p>
    If one day I am gone,
    let this project continue with the same purpose:
    to protect dignity,
    to reduce suffering,
    and to remind the world
    that humanity still matters.
  </p>
</section>
  
  <section class="section light">
  <h3>Mission Lock</h3>

  <p>
    B2H was created for one reason only:
    to help human beings in need.
  </p>

  <p>
    This mission is permanent.
    It cannot be changed by profit,
    popularity, pressure, or power.
  </p>

  <p>
    No individual, including the founder,
    has the right to redirect B2H away from serving humanity.
    Leadership exists only as responsibility,
    never as ownership.
  </p>

  <p>
    All systems, funds, and decisions must answer one question:
    does this reduce human suffering?
    If the answer is no, it must not be done.
  </p>

  <p>
    If one day this project grows beyond its founder,
    this mission must remain untouched.
    B2H must never exist to enrich a few
    while many suffer.
  </p>

  <p>
    This mission lock stands as a promise —
    to the poor,
    to the forgotten,
    and to future generations —
    that B2H will always choose humanity first.
  </p>
</section>
  
  <section class="section">
  <h3>Transparency & Use of Funds</h3>

  <p>
    Trust is sacred.
    B2H understands that people do not give blindly —
    they give when they feel respected and protected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every resource connected to B2H exists for a clear purpose:
    to help people in need,
    to sustain humanitarian operations,
    and to ensure this mission can continue for generations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Funds are allocated with responsibility and restraint,
    including humanitarian aid,
    operational sustainability,
    outreach,
    and the basic functioning required to serve people globally.
  </p>

  <p>
    No funds exist for luxury,
    excess,
    or personal enrichment.
    Leadership expenses are limited to what is necessary
    to carry the mission responsibly,
    not to profit from it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transparency is not a promise for later —
    it is a principle from the beginning.
    As B2H grows,
    records, summaries, and disclosures
    will be shared openly to maintain public trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every decision involving funds must pass one test:
    does this protect dignity,
    reduce suffering,
    and strengthen our ability to help?
    If not, it must not proceed.
