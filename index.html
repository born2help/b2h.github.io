  <h3>About the Founder</h3>
  <p>
    I am not a corporation, a venture capitalist, or a billionaire.
    I am a human being who has seen pain, struggle, and injustice,
    and I chose to dedicate the rest of my life to helping others.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the age of 56, I understand that life is temporary.
    What remains is intention, honesty, and the impact we leave behind.
    B2H was created not for wealth, but for responsibility.
