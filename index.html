    <h1>Burn<br>to<br>Help</h1>
    <h2>Born for Humanity</h2>

    <p>
      A global mission where every participation contributes to helping
      the poor, protecting human dignity, and building a future that
      Allah loves.
    </p>

    <p>
      B2H is built for people who believe that doing good and protecting
      value can exist together — for our families, for our children,
      and for those who have nothing.

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>

  <p>
    B2H was not created as a trend, a business, or a promise of quick wealth.
    It was created from a responsibility — toward people who suffer quietly,
    and toward Allah, who sees every intention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Around the world, millions of families struggle in silence.
    They do not ask loudly.
    They endure with dignity while hoping that someone, somewhere, still cares.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H exists to become that someone —
    to transform participation into relief,
    value into dignity,
    and growth into real human impact.
  </p>

  <p>
    This mission is not temporary.
    It is a lifelong commitment to reduce suffering,
    protect human dignity,
    and ensure that helping others remains at the heart of everything we do.
