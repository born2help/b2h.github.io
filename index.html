    <p>“We were not created to accumulate endlessly, but to protect dignity,
    relieve suffering, and leave behind goodness that Allah accepts.”</p>

    <p>“This mission was not created for wealth, power, or recognition. It was
    created because silence in the face of suffering is also a form of injustice.”</p>

<!-- ================= MISSION & PROMISE ================= -->
<section class="mission-wrapper">

  <div class="mission-card">
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      B2H was not created as a trend, a business, or a promise of quick wealth.
      It was created from responsibility — toward people who suffer quietly,
      and toward Allah, who sees every intention.
    </p>

     <p>
    B2H exists to become that someone —
    to transform participation into relief,
    value into dignity,
    and growth into real human impact.
  </p>

    <p>
    This mission is not temporary.
    It is a lifelong commitment to reduce suffering,
    protect human dignity,
    and ensure that helping others remains at the heart of everything we do.
  </p>
    
    <p>
      Around the world, millions endure with dignity while hoping that someone,
      somewhere, still cares. B2H exists to become that someone.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="promise-card">
    <h3>Our Promise</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No interest (Riba)</li>
      <li>No exploitation</li>
      <li>No personal enrichment</li>
      <li>Every contribution serves humanity only</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

</section>

  <section class="section">
  <h3>Are We Really Making History?</h3>
  <p>
    Not by launching a token.
    Not by numbers on a screen.
    Not by promises of wealth.
  </p>
  <p>
    History is made when dignity is protected,
    when hunger is reduced,
    when someone survives because help arrived in time.
  </p>
  <p>
    If B2H ever fails to serve the poor,
    then no technology, structure, or growth will matter.
