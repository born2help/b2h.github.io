  <h3>About the Founder</h3>
  <p>
    I am not a rich man. I am not powerful. I do not come from privilege.
    I am an ordinary human being who has lived a long life,
    seen struggle closely, and felt pain deeply.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am 56 years old. I do not know how much time I have left in this world,
    but I know one thing with certainty:
    the rest of my life must be spent helping others.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have seen families break because of hunger,
    children lose dreams because of poverty,
    and good people suffer silently with no one to help them.
    This project was born from those moments.
  </p>
  <p>
    B2H is not about money.
    It is about responsibility.
    It is about standing up when you can no longer look away.
    It is about choosing humanity over comfort.
  </p>
  <p>
    I promise with my heart:
    as long as I am alive,
    this project will never betray the poor,
    never exploit trust,
    and never forget why it was created.
