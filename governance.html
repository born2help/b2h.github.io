      <h2>Ethics over power. Mission over ambition.</h2>
      <p>
        B2H is designed to protect humanity first.
        Governance is structured to prevent abuse, drift, or profit-driven distortion.

  <!-- Governance Core Sections -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Governance Principles</h3>
    <p>
      B2H is governed by responsibility, not ownership.
      Leadership exists only as a trust — never as a right to exploit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The founder serves B2H and the mission.
      Authority exists solely to protect the purpose: helping humanity with dignity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Founder Safeguard</h3>
    <p>
      The founder manages resources only for humanitarian aid, operational sustainability, outreach,
      and minimum necessary requirements to carry this responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      No funds may be used for luxury or personal enrichment.
      All actions must be documented, reasonable, and aligned with the mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travel, representation, and communication are permitted only to strengthen the project.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Mission Lock</h3>
    <p>
      The mission of B2H is permanent.
      It cannot be altered, diluted, or redirected by profit, pressure, popularity, or power.
    </p>
    <p>
      No individual — including the founder — may change the purpose of this project.
      Leadership changes must never compromise the mission.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Transparency Commitment</h3>
    <p>
      Transparency is a duty. Summaries of humanitarian impact, operations, and governance practices
      will be shared responsibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trust is sacred. Without trust, the project has no right to exist.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Governance Capture Resistance -->
  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Governance Capture Resistance</h3>
    <p>
      B2H assumes power accumulation attempts will occur.
      The framework exists to prevent silent takeovers, ethical erosion, and mission drift.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Ethics Override Governance</h3>
    <p>
      No governance mechanism, vote, committee, or operational decision may override
      the ethical mission of B2H.
    </p>
    <p>
      Profitable, popular, or legally permissible decisions violating conscience are invalid.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>No Capital-Based Authority</h3>
    <p>
      Financial participation does not grant governance rights or influence over mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      B2H rejects governance based on capital, tokens, or investment size.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Founder Ethical Veto</h3>
    <p>
      The founder holds a limited ethical veto to block mission distortion, exploitation, or capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      This veto cannot be used for personal benefit or operational micromanagement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Multi-Layer Governance Lock</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Public Constitution defining purpose</li>
      <li>Non-negotiable Ethical Clauses</li>
      <li>Private Continuity Designation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No single layer is sufficient alone. All must align for governance legitimacy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Protection Against Internal Drift</h3>
    <p>
      Committees or leadership bodies may advise and execute but never redefine mission.
      Authority is conditional; purpose is permanent.
    </p>
