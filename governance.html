  <h1>B2H Governance</h1>
  <p><em>Accountability • Transparency • Responsibility</em></p>

  <h2>🏛 Governance Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    B2H is governed with the belief that
    power must always serve people —
    never the other way around.

  <h2>👤 Founder Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    The founder serves as the primary steward of the mission,
    accountable to the Constitution and humanity itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    All decisions must align with:
    helping the poor,
    protecting integrity,
    and ensuring long-term sustainability.
  </p>

  <h2>📊 Transparency & Reporting</h2>
  <p>
    Treasury usage, burns, and humanitarian distributions
    will be publicly communicated through the website
    and official channels.

  <h2>🔒 Mission Protection</h2>
  <p>
    No governance change may override the Mission Lock.
    This protects B2H from corruption, capture, or misuse.
