  <h3>Founder Safeguard & Ethical Compensation</h3>

  <p>
    B2H recognizes that leadership requires sacrifice,
    responsibility, and lifelong commitment.
  </p>

  <p>
    To ensure stability, continuity, and the ability
    to serve humanity effectively,
    the Founder is entitled to ethical compensation
    strictly for operational leadership,
    global representation,
    family responsibility,
    and personal sustainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Founder compensation shall never be derived
    directly from funds allocated for humanitarian aid.
  </p>

  <p>
    A defined portion of the Project Treasury
    may be allocated for:
    leadership expenses,
    travel for mission-related work,
    administrative operations,
    and basic founder livelihood —
    without excess, luxury, or exploitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Founder does not own B2H.
    The Founder serves B2H.
  </p>

  <p>
    All founder-related allocations must remain:
    transparent,
    publicly declared,
    and aligned with the mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    If any future leader violates this trust,
    the community and the constitution
    retain moral authority to protect the mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    This safeguard exists not to enrich individuals,
    but to ensure B2H never collapses
    due to neglect of its human leadership.
