  <h3>Governance & Founder Safeguard</h3>

  <p>
    B2H is governed by responsibility, not ownership.
    Leadership exists only as a trust — never as a right to exploit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The founder does not own B2H.
    The founder serves B2H.
  </p>

  <p>
    All authority exists solely to protect the mission:
    helping human beings in need with dignity and sincerity.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Founder Safeguard</h3>

  <p>
    The founder may manage funds only for purposes directly related
    to humanitarian aid, operational sustainability, outreach,
    and the minimum requirements necessary to carry this responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    No funds may be used for luxury, excess, or personal enrichment.
    Any expenses must be reasonable, documented,
    and aligned with the mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    The founder may travel, communicate, and represent the project
    only to strengthen its ability to help people —
    never to benefit personally.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Mission Lock</h3>

  <p>
    The mission of B2H is permanent.
    It cannot be altered, diluted, or redirected
    by profit, pressure, popularity, or power.
  </p>

  <p>
    No individual — including the founder —
    may change the purpose of this project.
  </p>

  <p>
    If leadership ever changes,
    the mission must remain untouched:
    humanity always comes first.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Transparency Commitment</h3>

  <p>
    Transparency is a duty, not a feature.
    As B2H grows, summaries of humanitarian impact,
    operational use, and governance practices
    will be shared openly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trust is sacred.
    Without trust, this project has no right to exist.

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Governance Capture Resistance</h3>

  <p>
    B2H is designed with the assumption that
    power accumulation attempts will occur over time.
    This framework exists to prevent silent takeovers,
    ethical erosion, and mission drift.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Ethics Override Governance</h3>

  <p>
    No governance mechanism, vote, committee,
    or operational decision may override
    the ethical mission of B2H.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a decision is profitable, popular,
    or legally permissible
    but violates conscience,
    it is considered invalid.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>No Capital-Based Authority</h3>

  <p>
    Financial participation does not grant
    voting rights, governance authority,
    or influence over mission direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H explicitly rejects governance
    based on capital, tokens, or investment size.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Founder Ethical Veto</h3>

  <p>
    The founder holds a limited ethical veto
    strictly to block mission distortion,
    exploitation, or governance capture.
  </p>

  <p>
    This veto cannot be used
    for personal benefit,
    financial extraction,
    or operational micromanagement.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section light">
  <h3>Multi-Layer Governance Lock</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Public Constitution defining purpose</li>
    <li>Non-negotiable Ethical Clauses</li>
    <li>Private Continuity Designation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    No single layer is sufficient on its own.
    All must align for governance legitimacy.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Protection Against Internal Drift</h3>

  <p>
    Committees, councils, or leadership bodies
    may advise and execute —
    but never redefine mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    Authority is conditional.
    Purpose is permanent.
  </p>
