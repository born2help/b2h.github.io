  <h3>The B2H Constitution</h3>

  <p>
    B2H exists to serve humanity.
    This purpose is permanent and cannot be replaced,
    diluted, or ignored.
  </p>

  <p>
    The poor, the vulnerable, and the forgotten
    are not beneficiaries —
    they are the reason this project exists.
  </p>

  <p>
    No person owns B2H.
    Leadership is a duty of service,
    not a right to profit or control.
  </p>

  <p>
    All systems, funds, and authority
    must remain aligned with the mission
    to reduce human suffering
    and protect dignity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Decisions must be guided by conscience,
    not greed;
    by compassion,
    not convenience;
    by responsibility,
    not power.
  </p>

  <p>
    If leadership ever fails this mission,
    the mission must outlive leadership.
    The purpose of B2H must never be sacrificed
    for personal gain or external pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transparency is not optional.
    Accountability is not conditional.
    Trust must be earned continuously.
  </p>

  <p>
    This constitution stands as a promise —
    to humanity today
    and to generations tomorrow —
    that B2H will always choose
    service over self.

  <h3>Founder Safeguard & Ethical Compensation</h3>

  <p>
    B2H recognizes that leadership requires sacrifice,
    responsibility, and lifelong commitment.
  </p>

  <p>
    To ensure stability, continuity, and the ability
    to serve humanity effectively,
    the Founder is entitled to ethical compensation
    strictly for operational leadership,
    global representation,
    family responsibility,
    and personal sustainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Founder compensation shall never be derived
    directly from funds allocated for humanitarian aid.
  </p>

  <p>
    A defined portion of the Project Treasury
    may be allocated for:
    leadership expenses,
    travel for mission-related work,
    administrative operations,
    and basic founder livelihood —
    without excess, luxury, or exploitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Founder does not own B2H.
    The Founder serves B2H.
  </p>

  <p>
    All founder-related allocations must remain:
    transparent,
    publicly declared,
    and aligned with the mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    If any future leader violates this trust,
    the community and the constitution
    retain moral authority to protect the mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    This safeguard exists not to enrich individuals,
    but to ensure B2H never collapses
    due to neglect of its human leadership.
