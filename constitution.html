    “This project was not born from wealth,  
    but from pain, responsibility, and a promise  
    to never ignore human suffering.”

  <h2>🌍 Mission Lock</h2>
  <p>
    B2H exists for one eternal purpose:  
    <strong>to help the poor, the needy, and forgotten families across the world.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This mission can never be changed, paused, sold, or redirected —  
    regardless of price, popularity, or leadership.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>🛡 Founder Safeguard</h2>
  <p>
    To protect the mission, the founder is ethically safeguarded.
    This ensures the ability to travel, coordinate globally,
    protect family responsibilities, and sustain leadership —
    <strong>without exploiting humanitarian funds.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This safeguard exists not for luxury, but for continuity,
    honesty, and lifelong service to humanity.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>💰 Treasury & Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    All treasury movements are recorded, transparent,
    and aligned with humanitarian impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every burn represents both:
    <strong>deflation for holders</strong>  
    and  
    <strong>relief for human lives.</strong>
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>🤝 Promise to the World</h2>
  <p>
    B2H promises honesty over hype,  
    service over greed,  
    and humanity over power.
