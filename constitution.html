  <h3>B2H Constitution</h3>

  <p>
    This Constitution exists to protect the purpose, integrity,
    and humanity of the B2H project — now and forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H was created as a humanitarian initiative.
    It exists to help people in need, protect human dignity,
    and build systems that serve humanity rather than exploit it.
  </p>

  <p>
    No success, popularity, or financial pressure
    may ever justify moving B2H away from this purpose.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>1. Mission Lock</h3>

  <p>
    The mission of B2H is permanent and non-negotiable.
    It exists solely to serve humanity and reduce suffering.
  </p>

  <p>
    No individual, group, or authority —
    including the founder —
    may alter this mission for personal, political, or financial gain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any action that contradicts this mission
    is considered a violation of the Constitution.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>2. Founder Safeguard</h3>

  <p>
    The founder serves as a guardian of the mission,
    not an owner of the project.
  </p>

  <p>
    Founder authority exists only to:
    protect integrity,
    ensure transparency,
    and prevent exploitation or deviation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The founder may not use B2H
    for personal enrichment or excessive benefit.
  </p>

  <p>
    All founder-related resources are limited to
    reasonable operational and representation needs,
    strictly aligned with the mission.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>3. Use of Funds</h3>

  <p>
    All funds, assets, and resources connected to B2H
    exist for three purposes only:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Humanitarian assistance and aid</li>
    <li>Operational sustainability</li>
    <li>Mission protection and growth</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    No funds may be used for luxury,
    excess,
    or exploitation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>4. Transparency</h3>

  <p>
    Transparency is a foundational principle of B2H.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the project grows,
    summaries, disclosures, and reports
    will be shared publicly to maintain trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    Openness is not optional —
    it is a responsibility.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>5. Permanence</h3>

  <p>
    This Constitution exists to outlive individuals.
  </p>

  <p>
    If leadership changes,
    the mission, safeguards, and principles
    must remain intact.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H must never become a tool
    for the enrichment of a few
    while others suffer.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <p>
    This Constitution stands as a promise —
    to participants,
    to the vulnerable,
    and to future generations —
    that B2H will always choose humanity first.
