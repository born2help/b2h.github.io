  <h3>How Burns Help Humanity</h3>

  <p>
    In many projects, burning tokens is done only to increase price.
    In B2H, burning exists for something far greater.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every burn represents a conscious sacrifice —
    a decision to reduce supply so that value can be redirected
    toward helping real human beings.
  </p>

  <p>
    A portion of every burn is allocated to humanitarian support:
    food, shelter, medical help, and emergency assistance
    for families who are struggling to survive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another portion strengthens the project itself —
    ensuring that B2H can continue operating,
    expanding, and serving people without dependence or exploitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This balance allows B2H to grow responsibly:
    helping people today,
    while protecting the mission for tomorrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Burns are not destruction.
    They are transformation —
    turning participation into dignity,
    and value into mercy.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you participate in B2H,
    you are not only part of a system —
    you are part of a service.
