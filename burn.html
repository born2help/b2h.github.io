  <h2>🔥 What Does “Burn” Mean?</h2>
  <p>
    In B2H, a burn means permanently removing
    a portion of tokens from circulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    This protects long-term value
    and prevents uncontrolled inflation.
  </p>

  <h2>🤲 Where Humanity Comes In</h2>
  <p>
    With B2H, every burn is connected to
    real-world humanitarian intention.
  </p>
  <p>
    A portion of the system’s activity
    supports food, shelter, medical aid,
    and emergency relief —
    transparently and responsibly.

  <h2>⚖ Balance Between Value & Help</h2>
  <p>
    B2H is designed so that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Holders are protected from dilution</li>
    <li>Humanitarian work remains sustainable</li>
    <li>No side is exploited</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌍 A Long-Term Vision</h2>
  <p>
    As the ecosystem grows,
    the impact grows —
    not through hype,
    but through consistency.
