      <h2>A responsibility before wealth</h2>

      <p>
        B2H was not born from abundance.
        It was born from conscience.

    <h3>Why B2H Exists</h3>

    <p>
      Around the world, suffering does not always scream.
      It lives quietly inside homes where parents worry in silence,
      where dignity is preserved even when hope is fading.
    </p>

    <p>
      B2H exists because ignoring this suffering
      is no longer acceptable.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project was created by someone who has lived long enough
      to understand that time is limited,
      strength fades,
      but responsibility does not.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Faith & Accountability</h3>

    <p>
      B2H is built on the belief that wealth is a trust,
      not an entitlement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every decision is taken with awareness
      that accountability is not only public —
      it is also before Allah.
    </p>

    <p>
      If an action does not reduce human suffering,
      protect dignity,
      or serve the greater good,
      it has no place in this mission.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Participation With Purpose</h3>

    <p>
      People participate in B2H for different reasons.
      Some think about their children’s future.
      Some think about humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
      B2H respects both intentions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, participation is designed so that
      value protection and humanitarian impact
      can exist together —
      without deception,
      without exploitation,
      and without false promises.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>Founder Restraint</h3>

    <p>
      Leadership in B2H is not ownership.
      It is responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The founder does not possess unrestricted power,
      unlimited access,
      or personal entitlement to this mission.
    </p>

    <p>
      Safeguards exist so that no individual —
      now or in the future —
      can redirect B2H away from serving humanity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>A Long-Term Promise</h3>

    <p>
      B2H is not designed for speed.
      It is designed for endurance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if leadership changes,
      even if circumstances shift,
      the purpose must remain untouched.
    </p>

    <p>
      This vision stands as a promise
      to the poor,
      to participants,
      and to future generations —
      that humanity will always come first.
