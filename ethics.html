      <h1>🌍 Ethics Charter</h1>
      <h2>The soul of Burn to Help</h2>

      <p>
        This charter exists to protect
        conscience over profit,
        humanity over numbers,
        and responsibility over power.

  <section class="section">
    <h3>1. Humanity Above All</h3>
    <p>
      Every decision within B2H
      must first answer one question:
      does this protect or improve
      a human life or dignity?
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>2. No Harm Principle</h3>
    <p>
      B2H will not knowingly support,
      enable, or benefit from
      harm, exploitation,
      deception, or injustice —
      even if profitable.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>3. Wealth Is a Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
      Any value created within B2H
      is a trust, not an entitlement.
      It must serve people,
      not ego or excess.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>4. Leadership Is Accountability</h3>
    <p>
      Leadership within B2H exists
      to serve the mission —
      not to dominate it,
      own it,
      or extract from it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>5. Long-Term Thinking</h3>
    <p>
      B2H rejects short-term hype
      in favor of long-term impact.
      Decisions must protect
      future generations,
      not just current attention.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>6. Faith & Conscience</h3>
    <p>
      B2H acknowledges accountability
      beyond systems and laws —
      accountability before conscience,
      humanity,
      and Allah.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>7. Irreversibility</h3>
    <p>
      These principles are permanent.
      If B2H ever violates them,
      it loses its right to exist.
