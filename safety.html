      <h2>Because no good deed should become a burden</h2>

      <p>
        B2H was not created for pressure,
        desperation,
        or reckless participation.
        It was created for responsibility,
        balance,
        and long-term good.

    <h3>Read This First</h3>

    <p>
      Life teaches us something slowly:
      good intentions are not enough.
      Responsibility matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project exists to help humanity —
      not to create financial stress,
      false hope,
      or pressure on anyone.
    </p>

    <h3>Who Should Participate</h3>

    <p>
      Participation is meant only for those
      who can do so calmly,
      without harming their family,
      without sacrificing necessities,
      and without borrowing or pressure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Who Should Not Participate</h3>

    <p>
      If participation would:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cause hardship or debt</li>
      <li>Create emotional pressure or fear</li>
      <li>Replace basic family needs</li>
      <li>Be done out of desperation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Then it should not be done.
    </p>

    <h3>No Promises of Certainty</h3>

    <p>
      B2H does not promise guaranteed returns,
      instant wealth,
      or risk-free outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyone claiming otherwise
      does not speak for this project.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h3>Conscience Over Numbers</h3>

    <p>
      Growth that harms people
      is not success.
    </p>

    <p>
      If B2H ever grows large,
      it must still protect the smallest participant.
    </p>

  <section class="section light">
    <h3>A Personal Note</h3>

    <p>
      This project was shaped
      by years of observing
      how easily hope can be misused.
    </p>

    <p>
      B2H chooses restraint
      where others choose hype.
      Because some lessons
      are learned only with time.
