  <p><em>Written with responsibility, not ambition</em></p>

    I did not start B2H because I am rich.
    I started it because I have seen what it means
    to live with responsibility and limited means.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have seen families who work hard,
    yet still sleep hungry.
    I have seen children whose future depends
    on help that never comes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At my age, I no longer chase luxury.
    I chase meaning.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H was born from a promise I made to myself:
    <strong>if I am given time on this earth,
    I will use it to reduce suffering,
    even if only a little.</strong>

    This project is not about becoming greater than others.
    It is about becoming useful to those
    who have no voice, no access, and no support.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    I may not see the end of this journey.
    But I want B2H to continue long after me —
    helping quietly, honestly, and without pride.

    If you are reading this,
    know that your participation is not just financial.
    It is moral.
    It is human.

    Thank you for believing that
    helping others is still worth building for.
