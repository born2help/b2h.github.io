  <p><em>Why B2H Exists</em></p>
</header>

<section>
  <p>
    I am not writing this as a wealthy person,
    nor as someone chasing fame or power.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am writing as a human being who has seen pain,
    responsibility, and families struggling to survive.
  </p>

  <p>
    B2H was born from a simple belief:
    <strong>if people come together with honesty,
    they can change lives.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I may not live forever.
    But I want this mission to live beyond me —
    helping millions, quietly, consistently, truthfully.

    This project is not about becoming rich.
    It is about becoming useful.

    If you are here,
    thank you for believing that helping others
    is still the greatest investment.
