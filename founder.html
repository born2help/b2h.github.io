    <blockquote>
      B2H was not created from wealth.<br>
      It was created from responsibility —
      responsibility toward people,
      and responsibility before Allah.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Around the world, millions of families struggle silently.
      Hunger, fear, and uncertainty exist behind closed doors,
      unseen by most, but deeply felt by those who live it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Helping such people is not charity alone.
      It is an act loved by Allah
      and a duty placed upon every conscience.
    </p>

    <p>
      B2H was born from one belief:
      <strong>that wealth should serve humanity,
      not control it.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      When you participate in B2H,
      you are not only participating in a project.
      A portion of your participation is directed toward
      real help, real dignity, and real relief
      for those who need it most.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, your trust is treated with respect.
      This platform is built with transparency,
      safeguards, and clear accountability —
      so that doing good never requires blind faith.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some people participate thinking of their children’s future.
      Some participate only to help others.
      <strong>B2H respects both intentions.</strong>
      Here, compassion and responsibility walk together.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do not promise riches.
      I promise sincerity,
      discipline,
      and a lifelong commitment
      to protect this mission from misuse or dishonesty.
    </p>

    <p>
      If even one family sleeps with less fear
      because of B2H,
      then this effort is worth more
      than numbers, prices, or titles —
      in this world and the next.
    </p>
