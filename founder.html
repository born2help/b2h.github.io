  <h1>A Message from the Founder</h1>
  <p><em>Faith • Responsibility • Humanity</em></p>
</header>

<section>
  <p>
    B2H was not created from wealth.
    It was created from responsibility —
    responsibility toward people,
    and responsibility before Allah.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    Around us are millions of families
    who struggle silently.
    Helping them is not charity alone —
    it is an act loved by Allah
    and a duty of humanity.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    When you participate in B2H,
    a part of your participation
    is directed toward helping those in need.
  </p>
  <p>
    And at the same time,
    your participation is treated with respect,
    care, and transparency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some people invest thinking about
    their children’s future.
    Some participate only to help others.
    <strong>B2H respects both intentions.</strong>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    This project is built so that
    helping people and protecting value
    can exist together —
    without dishonesty,
    without exploitation,
    and without false promises.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    I do not promise riches.
    I promise sincerity,
    accountability,
    and a lifelong commitment
    to use this platform for good.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    If even one family sleeps better
    because of B2H,
    then this effort is worth it —
    in this world and the next.
